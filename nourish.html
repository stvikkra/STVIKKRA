        <p class="nourish_text">Plant Based eating is a serious trend that isn’t going anywhere. There are several environmental, health, and ethical reasons why this lifestyle is exponentially growing. “Nourish” is a motivational guide to the lifestyle of plant based eating. The main tools assist with recipes and nutritional information, which can all be shared with a community.

While plant-based eating is on the rise, there is definitely a negative stigma associated with Veganism. It is also difficult for some people to know what to make or buy since they have been eating animal products their whole life. I wanted to make sure I designed this app as judgement free, and as a tool that gives people the information and resources to make a switch to a plant-based lifestyle and encourages them to go at their own pace.<br /><br />

On the path to modeling an app to help people eat plant-based, I needed to get the insight of people who aren’t plant-based. Being a vegan for 6 years makes me biased. I initially thought to develop the app after fitness tracking apps, or apps that help people quit smoking. Instead, the research formed a base that showed an educational tool would be a better route.

        <p id="responses_1">I crafted a survey that I posted on various facebook groups. I chose groups that were intrigued with a plant based lifestyle like; Journey to Zero Waste, Vegetarians, and Plant-Based Transitioning and Support. </p>

        <p id="responses_2">
I then sorted my participants into three main categories, (Vegan/Plant-Based, Vegetarians, and Meat Eaters), based off how they identified. I asked questions unique for each group, as well as a section for all groups (including demopraphics).</p>

The two features that stood out the most were the recipe creator and daily notifications that show environmental and health impacts you have made.</p>
