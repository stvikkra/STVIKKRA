        <p class="nourish_text">Plant Based eating is a serious trend that isn’t going anywhere. There are several environmental, health, and ethical reasons why this lifestyle is exponentially growing. “Nourish” is a motivational guide to the lifestyle of plant based eating. The main tools assist with recipes and nutritional information, which can all be shared with a community.

While plant-based eating is on the rise, there is definitely a negative stigma associated with Veganism. It is also difficult for some people to know what to make or buy since they have been eating animal products their whole life. I wanted to make sure I designed this app as judgement free, and as a tool that gives people the information and resources to make a switch to a plant-based lifestyle and encourages them to go at their own pace.<br /><br />

On the path to modeling an app to help people eat plant-based, I needed to get the insight of people who aren’t plant-based. Being a vegan for 6 years makes me biased. I initially thought to develop the app after fitness tracking apps, or apps that help people quit smoking. Instead, the research formed a base that showed an educational tool would be a better route.

        <h2 class="title" id="demo_title"> Demographics</h2>
        <p class="user_subtext">This data shows that the majority of Vegans were in the Low Income and Lower Middle Class brackets. The majority of Meat Eaters were found in the Middle Class brackets. This shows that Vegans are able to make their lifestyle work on a budget, even though one of the top concerns is affordability. Interestingly, Vegetarians had the highest percentage in the Low Income bracket and Upper Middle Class to High Income brackets. This data may be an outlier, but I think it tells us that many vegetarians are not sure how to be vegan on a budget. Also, that there is still a large amount of wealthy vegetarians that choose the lifestyle for other reasons. </p>

Toby is unhappy with his weight and falls into the obese category. He has adopted the flexitarian lifestyle to help him lose weight and build muscle. He uses Myfitnesspal to track all his nutrients so he is looking for nutritional guidance on plant-based substitutes.            </p>

Carrie has never enjoyed meat very much and when she realized that a vegetarian lifestyle was healthier and better for the environement, she made the switch. She is very intrigued about cutting all animal products out and going plant-based for health reasons.            </p>

Carrie is definitely scared to go vegan because of the stigma in community towards vegetarians. She is looking for a welcoming, non-judgemental community online to guide her and give her the boost she needs to make the switch. Finding recipes and asking questions to others willing to be patient and kind would make her feel comfortable with improving her diet.          </div>

Chelsea has eating disorder and struggles with gaining weight. Once pregnant, she was told to eat meat to gain weight so it made it difficult to transition back to vegetarianism. Since, she has worked hard to maintain a Plant-Based lifestyle but still struggles.  </p>

            <p class="col_text">
Chelsea’s biggest comlaint is with calorie counting culture. As someone who has an eating disorder, counting calories becomes obsessive and it’s not even a really great representation of your health. She really likes visually seeing charts and graphs on how nutrition works and is looking for more nutritional guidance rather than to actually track her meals.           </div>

            This project has been incredibly informative for me. It has forced me to see how others see the lifestyle that I live. For me, it feels easy and natural. But others struggle with this idea and the crazy amount of responses I received showed me that most people are seriously curious about the world of plant-based eating. I would love for this project to become a reality, but it would require quite a large amount of development in order to get these powerful tools to work. While this is not a perfectly complete vision, it shows a glimpse into a concept that could make life easier for people looking to become plant-based.
