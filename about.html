        <p id="begin">
          I saw my first bit of code when I was fourteen and modifying my band’s myspace page. The moment I realized that my high school offered web design classes, I signed up immediately. These classes introduced me to HTML/CSS from a young age. I graduated high school in 2014, so I began learning how to code when HTML5 was in its early stages, and using Adobe Dreamweaver was common practice. I loved it so much that I took additional technology and business classes my school offered, one of which was called Virtual Enterprise.
          <br /><br />
          This specific class functioned as a corporate company with different positions, such as CEO, CFO, Accounting and Marketing. With my web design experience, I held the web/graphic designer position. We were all able to compete with other classes that took Virtual Enterprise across the country and it was such a fun and interactive experience. I have always had a knack for technology and felt very artistic so my teachers all urged me to go down this path. </p>
